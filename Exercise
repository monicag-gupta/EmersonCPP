Create a menu-driven Employee Management System in C++ that allows you to:
Add Employees (Name, ID, Salary).
Display All Employees.
Search Employee by ID.
Delete Employee by ID.
Use OOP concepts (classes, encapsulation, inheritance) and pointers (dynamic memory, object pointers).


Step-by-Step Plan
Define an Employee class with:
  Data members: id, name, salary.
  Functions: display().
Use inheritance: Create a Manager class that extends Employee (with an extra field department).
Use pointers:
  Store employees in an array of Employees.
  Dynamically allocate memory using new.
  Use delete to free memory when deleting employees.
  Create a Menu System for user interaction.
