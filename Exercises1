Write a program in C++ to swap two numbers with and without using a third variable.



Solution:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int a, b,t;
    cout << "Enter a: ";
    cin >> a;
    cout << "Enter b: ";
    cin >> b;
    cout << "\n Original value: \n";
    cout << "a = " << a << " b = " << b << endl;
    cout << "\nSwap Using 3rd var:\n";
    t = a;
    a = b;
    b = t;
    cout << "a = " << a << " b = " << b << endl;
    cout << "\nSwap without Using 3rd var:\n";
    a = a + b;
    b = a - b;
    a = a - b;
    cout << "a = " << a << " b = " << b << endl;
    return 0;
}






Design a menu driven program with following choices:
1. Continue and Break example 
2. for syntax
3. while syntax
4. do..while syntax
5. goto syntax
6. Finished study (Exit)
Based on the choice by the user: 
Perform the operation
If the choice is 6, only then we exit, else the menu runs infinitely.




While:
init
While(cond){
Statements;
Inc/dec
}


For:
For(init;cond;inc/dec){ //range of value
}



Do..while:
Init;
Do{
Statements;
Inc/dec;
}while(cond); //at least this loop will run for 1 iteration



Go to :
Init;
Label: 
Statements
Inc/dec
If (cond) 
Goto label
