Write a program in C++ to swap two numbers with and without using a third variable.



Solution:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int a, b,t;
    cout << "Enter a: ";
    cin >> a;
    cout << "Enter b: ";
    cin >> b;
    cout << "\n Original value: \n";
    cout << "a = " << a << " b = " << b << endl;
    cout << "\nSwap Using 3rd var:\n";
    t = a;
    a = b;
    b = t;
    cout << "a = " << a << " b = " << b << endl;
    cout << "\nSwap without Using 3rd var:\n";
    a = a + b;
    b = a - b;
    a = a - b;
    cout << "a = " << a << " b = " << b << endl;
    return 0;
}
